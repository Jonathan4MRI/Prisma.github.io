Please contact Lara and Beth if you have questions regarding this.\n\nStep-by-step guide\n\n• This unit's longevity depends on it not being left on when not in use.\n• Please turn it off when you are done.\n• There is a button on the front of the gray Power Supply in the back right corner of the scanner room. Push this on (green light) and off after each use.\n• The flat wide side of the head coil mirror should face toward the monitor at the back of the bore.\n• Position the head coil mirror over the participant's eyes so that they do not need to move their head to see.\n\nUser Guide from NNL (link)\n\n[IMAGE_NNL_image1]",
