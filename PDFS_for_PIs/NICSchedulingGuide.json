  "text": "Neuroscape Imaging Core scheduling guidelines\n\n1. The Prisma has two global email lists:\n\nNIC_Active, used for scanner announcements, and\n\nNIC_Cancel, used when a scheduled booking becomes available again.\n\nTo get added to these Prisma's scheduling notification lists follow instructions at:\n\nhttps://wiki.library.ucsf.edu/display/Neuro/Neuroscape+Scanner+Lists\n\nPlease send an email to NIC_CANCEL@listserv.ucsf.edu when you cancel bookings within 15 business days of the scheduled time so someone else may use that spot.\n\n2. Do not schedule until you have a Participant lined up for the time slot you have selected or are ready to run a phantom. Holding spots without including participant specific anonymized ID in the Description while recruiting is not permitted.\n\n3. It is appropriate to email other researchers and ask them if they can move a scan up or down the schedule slightly to make yours fit somewhere.  Everyone tries to accommodate requests like that when possible.\n\n4. Scheduling Types, Testing and Training, should include one of those words in the Description section. Please schedule these either off hours or within 24 hours of the desired date/time. If scheduled further in advance, please yield to a participant booking if needed.\n\nThe above instructions are for scheduling on the Prisma's billing calendar. Do not include any ePHI, including initials, on this calendar as it is public.\n\nNote from NCRU: You or another team member are required to greet participants and their caregivers in the atrium of the building. Please be sure they have a way to reach you or another study member when they arrive.",
