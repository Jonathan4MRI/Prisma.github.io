The headphones are usually coiled up at the foot end of the patient table and plug into the yellow connector.\n\nSetup:\n\nSoftware:\n\nThe setup is identical to Serene Sound Headphone. Just make sure that sound output is set to USB Audio.\n\nOperation:\n\n• Listening: Press the Listen button and adjust the volume using the increase/decrease adjacent buttons.\n• Talking: Press and hold the Speak button.\n• Presenting Audio: Make sure the CV/CBT switch is switched to CV and the ‘Music’ button is pressed.\n\nConnections:\n\n• The headphones are connected to the yellow opening at the foot of the patient bed.\n• The central intercom unit is connected to the USB sound card via a dual RCA to 1/8” audio cable.\n\nSiemens Audio Diagram:\n\n[IMAGE_Sie_image2]",
